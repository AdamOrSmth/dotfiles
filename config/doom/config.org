** Progress Logging
=TODO= keywords, in video game lingo. I find it more amusing and light-hearted, which is a nice touch when looking at otherwise mundane tasks. Some of these are a stretch, but whatever.

+ MISSION :: Replacement for =TODO=: a task that's ready for me to start doing.
+ QUEST :: A project that contains multiple sequential or related =MISSION='s and is a larger endeavor, usually with a deadline and definitive finished state. Yes, mission and quest are generally synonymous, but one of them had to be for projects, and quests containing missions makes more sense than the opposite.
+ ACTIVE :: A mission that's I've started and is in progress.
+ WAITING :: Some factor is holding up the completion of this task.
+ SCHEME :: Replacement for =IDEA=: a thought that isn't completable, but instead needs further expansion/consideration.
+ INVESTIGATE :: An external source or information to look into later.
+ NEEDY :: Named after needy modules from =Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes=; a habit or repeating task.
+ COMPLETE :: Replacement for =DONE=: a finished task.
+ FAILED :: Not really for failure, but it fits the "quest" vibe: a task that's no longer applicable or doable. Also could indicate an unviable idea.
+ =[ ]= :: Checkbox version of =MISSION=.
+ =[-]= :: Checkbox version of =ACTIVE=.
+ =[?]= :: Checkbox version of =WAITING=.
+ =[X]= :: Checkbox version of =COMPLETE=.
+ =[#]= :: Checkbox version of =FAILED=.

#+end_src
*** File Types
Each subdirectory in my ~org-directory~ corresponds to a "type" of ~org-roam~ note. These code snippets integrate my file types into ~org-roam~ nicely.

Define an associative list for the names of each subdirectory to their respective icon. You could also simply use the subdirectory name alone, but I like having some pretty icons as well. Given the subdirectory name, fetching the icon is as simple as using the ~assoc~ function. ~nil~ is my Inbox file, which is the only file that resides in the root ~org-roam-directory~.
#+begin_src elisp
(defvar ad/org-roam-icons
  '(("fc"      . "üé¥")
    ("gtd"     . "üóì")
    ("journal" . "üìñ")
    ("log"     . "üóÉ")
    ("ref"     . "üìö")
    ("work"    . "‚úè")
    ("zettel"  . "üóí")
    (nil       . "üì•")))
#+end_src

Defining a custom method is how ~org-roam~ allows you to add custom properties to ~org-roam-node-display-template~, which controls the format of functions like ~org-roam-find-file~. I copied the extra font stuff from Doom's default setting for this variable, since I don't really understand how the font stuff works. This code partially comes from =hlissner='s own private configuration, as well as some of Doom's defaults. See the documentation of ~org-roam-node-display-template~ for more information. This has to run after ~org-roam~ loads, else it errors out from the method definition.
#+begin_src elisp
(after! org-roam
   (cl-defmethod org-roam-node-doom-prefix ((node org-roam-node))
     (cdr (assoc (org-roam-node-doom-type node)
                 ad/org-roam-icons)))
  (setq org-roam-node-display-template #("${doom-prefix} ${doom-hierarchy:*} ${todo:8} ${doom-type:12} ${doom-tags:24}" 20 35
                                         (face font-lock-keyword-face)
                                         36 51
                                         (face org-tag))))
#+end_src

I have my titles in my ~org-roam~ file names, as well as the timestamp of creation (which helps serve as a unique file name). I like to automatically have the file name titles in sync with the ~org-mode~ titles, which the following custom function does. I then add it as a hook to run right after save, since the ~org-roam~ values don't get updated before save. It first ensures that it's a file in a folder with managed file names, and then does some string parsing and whatnot to get a new file name, before running the Doom function to rename the file. I've found the Doom function works the best with Doom Emacs, since it's functionally equivalent to the interactive keybinding to move a file, which is what it should be. Keeps everything running smoothly.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun ad/update-roam-filename ()
  "Update org-roam file names when their titles change."
  (interactive)
  (when (and (org-roam-file-p)
             (-contains-p '("fc" "log" "outline" "ref" "work" "zettel") (f-filename (f-parent buffer-file-name))))
    (let ((new-file-location
          (concat
           (file-name-directory buffer-file-name)
           (s-replace-regexp "^\\([0-9]\\{14\\}\\).*" "\\1" (file-name-base buffer-file-name))
           "-"
           (-> (org-roam-node-at-point)
               (org-roam-node-file-title)
               (org-roam-node-from-title-or-alias)
               (org-roam-node-slug))
           ".org")))
      (unless (string-equal buffer-file-name new-file-location)
        (doom/move-this-file new-file-location)))))
(add-hook 'after-save-hook #'ad/update-roam-filename)
#+end_src
*** Capture Templates
In some templates, I fill in the ~org-attach~ directory automatically, useful for things like export paths for =gnuplot= or =graphviz=. However, by default, there's no function that both creates the directory and returns it; ~org-attach-dir-get-create~ doesn't accept an ID parameter, and the ID technically doesn't exist in the capture template, since it doesn't have an associated file until its initial save. No other method accepts an ID parameter /and/ creates the directory, so here's a simple one to fill my need.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun ad/org-attach-dir-get-create (id)
  "Return existing or new directory associated with the given ID."
  (let ((attach-dir (org-attach-dir-from-id id)))
    (unless (file-directory-p attach-dir)
      (make-directory attach-dir t))
    attach-dir))
#+end_src

This is just used to automagically get the HTML title of a URL, used in my website capture template.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun ad/get-html-title (url)
  "Retrieve a URL and return the HTML title. "
  (with-current-buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously url)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (re-search-forward "<title>\\([^<]*\\)</title>")
    (match-string 1)))
#+end_src

Just a different capture template for each different "type" of note. I do define a short helper function to avoid having to type out the expression for my templates directory over and over again. Otherwise, nothing too interesting going on. For assorted thoughts and tasks, I use normal ~org-mode~ capture templates into my Inbox instead.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun ad/roam-template-path (template)
  "Given a template name, return the org-roam template path."

Automatically turn on ~org-cdlatex-mode~ when opening files in my =work= directory, which is mainly where I'm using LaTeX. A simple minor mode that makes writing subscripts, superscripts, and math easier. See [[https://orgmode.org/manual/CDLaTeX-mode.html][here]] for more.

* Colemak-DH
The general consensus in the community is to just get used to the new positions of things, but I can't live without my =hjkl= navigation, and I don't feel like going through the work of making a proper extend layer (yet). So I'm just swapping the QWERTY and Colemak-DH positions, as well as deal with the few cascading changes, keeping things as minimal as possible. Where I have the luxury, I swap some of the positions I've already changed as well. Also there are some random variables to update, very fun. Luckily, the ~evil-collection-translate-key~ function makes it pretty easy to swap out all the keys in the appropriate keymaps. Also Magit doesn't work, I have to manually map; no idea why.

* mu4e
Putting my private email in public view for all to see probably isn't the most brilliant idea ever, so the relevant ~set-email-account!~ calls are in a file encrypted using =git-crypt= instead. That file gets loaded here.

By default Doom Emacs doesn't actually come with a keybind to open Elfeed, even though =SPC o e= doesn't have anything assigned to it, a perfect key to assign to opening Elfeed. Also I add ~elfeed-update~ to ~elfeed-search-mode-hook~ to automatically update the feed.
